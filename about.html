                Spud's Puds was started in 1982 when a group of ex service-men decided to bake and create the best cakes this side of Lake Ontario.<br>
                They started out slow, but now have such a reputation that customers come from all corners of the globe to taste and witness Spud's Puds.<br>
                Since 1985 Spud's Puds has provided delivery free of charge to the local area, we do not ship by aircraft!
